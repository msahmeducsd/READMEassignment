README assignment for BIMM 143 Project 2

Scientific Question: How does the up-regulation/down-regulation of oncogenes (e.g., MIR10B, EGFR, and/or TP53) correlate with the metastasis of brain tumors of diagnosed primary cancers (i.e., breast, lung, and/or thyroid) taken from biopsy data.  

Scientific Hypothesis: If the up-regulation of a specific oncogene (TBD) is identified in a diagnosed primary cancer (TBD), then there is a significant positive correlation in metastasis of brain tumors due to said oncogene.  

Data Files: The following data files are tentative as I am still trying to further explore options for the methods used.

- EGFR.fasta: FASTA file for the EGFR gene
